*Implemented using : Python3 + Flask + HTML(also uses Bootstrap CDN) + MongoDB*
<br>
<hr>


Following packages will be needed:
- `virtualenv`
- `python3` (all code is written and tested with python 3.5.2)<br>
- `flask`
- `flask-pymongo`

* Clone or download the repo
* Set up a virtual environment in the extracted directory of the repo using <br>` $ virtualenv --python=python<python_version> <whatever_name>`
* Switch to the virtual environment using `$ source <whatever_name>/bin/activate`
* Using `$ pip install flask flask-pymongo`, install *flask* and *flask-pymongo*
* In the terminal,`cd` to the `src` directory & run `$ python main.py`
